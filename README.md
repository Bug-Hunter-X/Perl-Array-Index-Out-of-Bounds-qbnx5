This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an array index out of bounds error and its solution. The bug.pl file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.pl provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an array element using an index that is greater than or equal to the array's size.  This can lead to undefined behavior or runtime exceptions depending on Perl's configuration and the context in which this error occurs. The solution involves adding a check to ensure the index is within the valid range of the array.
